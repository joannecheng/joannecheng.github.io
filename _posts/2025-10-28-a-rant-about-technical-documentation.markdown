title: My Rules for Writing Technical Documents

* **Get to the point.** Use straightforward language.
* **Show examples.** Examples communicate much better than prose
* **Do not make assumptions about the reader's background.**
Example: something common I see in Clojure writing is the assumption that Clojure developers all come from Java (or other object oriented languages),
without explicitly stating that Java knowledge is a requirement.
* like macros, metaphors can be useful but it makes your writing hard to understand when you have too many
* **Remember: Users come to your documentation to learn.**
If you want to be creative in your technical writing or provide a deeper explanation for your philosophies,
perhaps consider other creative mediums (personal blogs, talks) instead of documentation.

An extra rule for me:
* Do not assume the reader is an American English speaker.

Most programmers I know are juggling several tasks outside of programming,
especially as we get more senior.
We're planning cycles, attending product meetings, reviewing PRs, mentoring, and trying to meet deadlines.
When doing technical writing, a little bit of empathy for your reader goes a long way.
