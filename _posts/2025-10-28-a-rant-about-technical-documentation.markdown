title: My Rules for Writing Technical Documents

* **Get to the point.** Use straightforward language.
* **Show examples.** It's more effective to use examples rather than only using prose.
* **Use figurative language sparingly.**
Like macros, metaphors can be useful but it makes one's writing hard to understand when there are too many.
* **Remember: Users come to your documentation to learn.**
If you want to be creative in your technical writing or provide a deeper explanation for your philosophies,
perhaps consider other creative mediums (personal blogs, talks) instead of documentation.
* **Do not make too many assumptions about the reader's background.**

An extra rule for me and maybe the other Americans out there:
* **Do not assume the reader is an American English speaker.**

Whenever I write documentation, I try to imagine a frazzled employee who needs to juggle project meetings, PR reviews, mentoring, deadlines, all on top of regular programming tasks (me, essentially).
A little empathy for your readers goes a long way.
