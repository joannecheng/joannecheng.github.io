title: My Rules for Writing Technical Documents

* **Get to the point.** Use straightforward language.
* **Show examples.** It's more effective to use examples rather than only using prose.
* **Do not make assumptions about the reader's background.**
Example: I often see Clojure writing that assumes that the reader and all Clojure developers come from Java. Not every Clojure developer is a grizzled former Java developer.
* **Use figurative language sparingly.**
Like macros, metaphors can be useful but it makes one's writing hard to understand when there are too many.
* **Remember: Users come to your documentation to learn.**
If you want to be creative in your technical writing or provide a deeper explanation for your philosophies,
perhaps consider other creative mediums (personal blogs, talks) instead of documentation.

An extra rule for me and maybe the other Americans out there:
* **Do not assume the reader is an American English speaker.**

When we document a library, a programming project, technical design, or anything technical,
our job is to communicate

Most traditionally employed programmers I know are juggling several tasks outside of programming,
especially as we get more senior in our careers.
We're planning cycles, attending product meetings, reviewing PRs, mentoring, and trying to meet deadlines.

I personally keep these rules mind whenever I write anything technical,
like tutorials, open source documentation, or technical specifications for work.
A little empathy for your readers goes a long way.
