Pitch is a collaborative presentation tool meant to improve the presenation creation
experience.
The application was written almost entirely in Clojure and ClojureScript.
I worked at Pitch from 2018 - 2021 as a software engineer and Engineering Lead.
I worked on several teams, mostly focusing on the editor interface.
